---

Hello Twilio Support Team,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand the need for account verification to maintain platform security.

**Intended Use Case:**
Our application is an Elder Care Management System designed to monitor the health and medication compliance of elderly residents in care facilities. The phone numbers are intended to be used for:

1. **WhatsApp Notifications**: Sending critical health alerts to caregivers and medical staff when:
   - Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature) exceed safe thresholds
   - Medications are missed or overdue
   - Emergency situations require immediate staff notification

2. **Communication**: Facilitating communication between care facility staff, administrators, and family members regarding resident care.

**Company/Application Information:**
- **Application Name**: Elder Care Tracker / Elder Care Management System
- **Purpose**: Healthcare management software for elder care facilities
- **Website/Deployment**: [Your deployment URL - e.g., elderlycare.tech or your Render/Railway URL]
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/alexispinzongalindo/elderly-care-app
- **Use Case**: Automated health monitoring and alert system for elderly care facilities in Puerto Rico

**Technical Details:**
- The application uses Twilio's WhatsApp API to send automated health alerts
- Alerts are triggered by our monitoring service when dangerous vital sign values are detected
- Messages are sent to verified staff members and caregivers only
- This is a healthcare compliance and safety system, not for marketing or bulk messaging

**Compliance:**
- We comply with healthcare data privacy regulations
- All communications are opt-in and related to resident care
- No marketing or promotional messages will be sent
- All recipients are authorized staff members

**Additional Context:**
This is a legitimate healthcare management application serving elder care facilities. The phone numbers will be used exclusively for critical health alerts and care coordination. We are committed to using Twilio's services responsibly and in compliance with all terms of service.

Please let me know if you need any additional information to verify our account and use case.

Thank you for your assistance.
