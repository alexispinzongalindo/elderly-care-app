## If You Need More Resources (Future) 🔮

### Render Hosting Upgrade (If Needed):

| Plan | Cost | What You Get |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Free Tier** | **$0/month** | Current: 750 hours/month, may sleep after 15 min inactivity |
| **Starter** | **$7/month** | Always-on, 512MB RAM, better performance |
| **Standard** | **$25/month** | 1GB RAM, always-on, better for production |

**You DON'T need to upgrade unless:**
- App needs to be always-on (no sleep)
- Multiple concurrent users
- Larger database/performance needs

---

### Database Upgrade (If SQLite Becomes Limiting):

| Option | Cost | When Needed |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **SQLite (Current)** | **$0/month** | ✅ Perfect for now |
| **PostgreSQL (Render)** | **$0-7/month** | Only if >100MB data or multiple servers |
| **MySQL (External)** | **$5-15/month** | Only if SQLite becomes too slow |

**You DON'T need this for a long time** - SQLite handles millions of records fine for single-server apps.

## Cost Comparison: Current vs Alternatives

| Approach | Monthly Cost | Setup Cost | Total First Year |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Current Stack** | **$0** | $0 | **$0** |

| **+ Modular Code** | **$0** | $0 | **$0** |
| **+ React/Vue** | **$0** | $0 | **$0** |

- **If:** Many users, high database load
- **Cost:** Render Standard $25/month
- **When:** Only if free tier becomes slow
