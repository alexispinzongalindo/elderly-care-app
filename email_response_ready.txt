Company Information:

Company Name: Elderly Care Tech (Project/Working Name)

We are developing a comprehensive Elder Care Management System designed specifically for elderly care facilities in Puerto Rico. Our platform (currently in development) will provide:

Our software will help care facilities streamline their operations, improve patient care tracking, and maintain accurate health records in compliance with healthcare documentation requirements.

Company Registration:

We are currently in the early development phase of this project. Formal business entity registration has not yet been initiated, as we are still in the development and testing stage of the software platform. I am operating as an individual developer/entrepreneur working on this project. The domain elderlycare.tech was purchased to establish the digital presence for this initiative as we develop and refine the platform. We plan to formalize the business structure once we complete development and are ready to launch commercially.

As the domain owner and project developer, I can verify my association with elderlycare.tech through this email correspondence. I am happy to provide any additional information needed for verification purposes.

Additional Information:
I am the domain owner and primary developer working on the Elderly Care Management System project. The domain elderlycare.tech was purchased to establish the digital foundation for this healthcare technology initiative as we continue development and testing.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or documentation to complete the verification process. I'm available to provide further details or answer any questions you may have.
